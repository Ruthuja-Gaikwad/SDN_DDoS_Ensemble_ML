# SDN_DDoS_Ensemble_ML
Welcome to SDN_DDoS_Ensemble_ML, an advanced project enhancing DDoS attack detection and mitigation in Software Defined Networks (SDN). Using an ensemble online machine learning model, our approach effectively counters various DDoS threats, including low-rate and zero-day attacks, ensuring robust network security and performance.

# Features
1. Ensemble Online Machine Learning Model: Adapts dynamically to new DDoS attack patterns.
2. High Detection Accuracy: Achieves a 99.2% detection rate, outperforming existing models on multiple benchmark datasets.
3. Dynamic Feature Selection: Continuously updates with relevant features to handle low-rate and zero-day DDoS attacks.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: Validated using SDN simulations with Mininet and Ryu, and tested on datasets such as CICDDoS2019, InSDN, and KSL_NDD.


# Repository Structure
1. src/: Source code for the ensemble online machine learning model.
2. datasets/: Custom and benchmark datasets used for training and evaluation.
3. notebooks/: colab notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. scripts/: Utility scripts for running simulations and experiments in SDN environments.
